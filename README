# THIS TIDDLYWIKI SAVES TIDDLERS TO INDEX.HTML
Keep this in mind when wondering where data goes to or comes from
## Data is saved via the github plugin on the tiddlywiki itself. 
The plugin commits all changes to a monstrously large index.html file 
instead of saving tiddler files in their own directory
