# THIS IS NOT A NODE APP! JUST INDEX.HTML HOSTED ON FIREBASE!
# THIS TIDDLYWIKI SAVES TIDDLERS TO INDEX.HTML!
Keep this in mind when wondering where data goes to or comes from
## Data is saved via the github plugin on the wiki itself. 
The plugin commits changes to the wiki, on every save, to a monstrously large index.html file 
instead of saving tiddler files in their own directory.
